# Introduction

Welcome to `near-kit`.

If you have built on NEAR before, you know that the tooling can sometimes feel... heavy. `near-kit` is an attempt to fix that. It is a modern, lightweight, and opinionated TypeScript SDK designed to make interacting with the NEAR blockchain feel as simple as using `fetch`.

## Why `near-kit`?

### 1. It Speaks Human

We hate calculating zeros. Instead of forcing you to convert units manually or worry about big integers, `near-kit` accepts strings like `"10.5 NEAR"` or `"30 Tgas"`. The library handles the math and conversion for you.

### 2. Fluent API

Building transactions shouldn't require an instruction manual. `near-kit` uses a chainable builder pattern that makes your code read like a sentence:

```typescript
await near
  .transaction("alice.near")
  .createAccount("bob.alice.near")
  .transfer("bob.alice.near", "10 NEAR")
  .send()
```

### 3. Type Safety

We leverage TypeScript to catch bugs before you run your code. From typed errors to fully typed contract interfaces, your IDE is your best friend.

### 4. Universal

Whether you are writing a backend script, a frontend React dApp, or an integration test, your code looks exactly the same. Learn the API once, use it everywhere.
