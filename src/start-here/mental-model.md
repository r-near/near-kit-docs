# The Mental Model

To use `near-kit` effectively, there are only three concepts you need to internalize. If you understand these, you can guess 90% of the API.

## 1. Everything hangs off `Near`

The `Near` class is your single entry point. You initialize it once with your configuration (network and credentials), and reuse that instance everywhere.

```typescript
const near = new Near({ ...config });

// All operations start here:
near.view(...)
near.transaction(...)
near.getBalance(...)
```

## 2. We hate math (Units)

Blockchain development is plagued by unit conversion errors. `near-kit` solves this by using **Human-Readable Strings**.

- **Amounts:** Never count 24 zeros. Use `"1.5 NEAR"` or `"1 yocto"`.
- **Gas:** Never calculate gas units. Use `"30 Tgas"`.

The library parses these strings automatically. If you try to pass a raw number where a unit is expected, `near-kit` will throw an error to protect you from mistakes.

```typescript
// ✅ Good
near.transfer("bob.near", "5 NEAR")

// ❌ Bad (Throws Error)
near.transfer("bob.near", 5) // Did you mean 5 NEAR or 5 yocto?
```

## 3. Transactions are Fluent Chains

NEAR transactions can contain multiple actions (e.g., "Create Account" AND "Transfer Money"). `near-kit` models this as a fluent chain.

1.  **Start:** `.transaction(signer)` identifies _who is paying_.
2.  **Chain:** Add as many actions as you want (`.transfer`, `.functionCall`).
3.  **Send:** Call `.send()` to sign and broadcast.

```typescript
await near
  .transaction("alice.near") // 1. Start
  .createAccount("bob.alice.near") // 2. Chain
  .transfer("bob.alice.near", "1 NEAR") // 2. Chain
  .send() // 3. Send
```
