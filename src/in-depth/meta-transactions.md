# Meta-Transactions (Gasless)

Meta-transactions (NEP-366) allow a user to sign a transaction off-chain, which is then submitted and paid for by a separate "Relayer" account.

## How it Works

1.  **User (Client):** Constructs a transaction and calls `.delegate()`. This returns a **typed object** (for UI/validation) and a **serialized string** (for transport).
2.  **Transport:** The user sends the serialized string (`payload`) to your backend.
3.  **Relayer (Server):** Your server decodes the payload back into an object, validates it, wraps it, and submits it.

## 1. Client Side: Signing the Action

On the frontend, use the `.delegate()` method. This works exactly like `.send()`, but implies no network activity and no gas cost for the signer.

It returns two properties:

- `signedDelegateAction`: The raw JS object. Useful for debugging or showing details in your UI.
- `payload`: A Base64-encoded string. This is what you send to the server.

```typescript
// 1. Build the transaction
const transaction = userNear
  .transaction("user.near")
  .functionCall("game.near", "move", { x: 1, y: 2 })

// 2. Sign it off-chain
const { signedDelegateAction, payload } = await transaction.delegate({
  blockHeightOffset: 100, // Optional: Expire after ~100 blocks
})

// Inspect locally (Typed Object)
console.log("User signed for:", signedDelegateAction.delegateAction.receiverId)

// 3. Send the PAYLOAD to your API (Base64 String)
await fetch("https://api.mygame.com/relay", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ payload }),
})
```

---

## 2. Server Side: The Relayer

The server receives the Base64 string (`payload`). It must decode this string back into a typed object to inspect it before submitting.

Use `near-kit`'s `decodeSignedDelegateAction` helper for this.

### Example: Express.js Route

```typescript
import { Near, decodeSignedDelegateAction } from "near-kit"

const relayer = new Near({
  network: "testnet",
  privateKey: process.env.RELAYER_KEY,
})

app.post("/relay", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { payload } = req.body

    // 1. Decode the Base64 string back into a Typed Object
    const userAction = decodeSignedDelegateAction(payload)

    // 2. SECURITY: Inspect the object before paying for it!
    // access the inner details via .delegateAction
    const innerAction = userAction.delegateAction

    // Example Check: Only allow calls to "game.near"
    if (innerAction.receiverId !== "game.near") {
      return res.status(400).send("Invalid target contract")
    }

    // 3. Submit to the Network
    // The relayer wraps the user's action in its own transaction
    const result = await relayer
      .transaction("relayer.near")
      .signedDelegateAction(userAction)
      .send()

    res.json({ hash: result.transaction.hash })
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e)
    res.status(500).send("Relay failed")
  }
})
```

## Security Checklist

Running a relayer makes you a target.

1.  **Whitelist Receivers:** Always check `userAction.delegateAction.receiverId`.
2.  **Whitelist Methods:** Inspect `userAction.delegateAction.actions` to ensure users are only calling allowed methods (e.g., "move" vs "withdraw").
3.  **Rate Limiting:** Rate limit your API endpoint to prevent draining your relayer's funds.
