# Advanced Transactions

The `TransactionBuilder` allows you to orchestrate complex account management and state changes. Understanding how these actions execute is critical for writing safe smart contracts and scripts.

## 1. Atomicity & Execution

All actions added to a single transaction are executed **sequentially as one atomic unit on-chain**:

- If **all actions succeed**, the state changes produced by those actions are committed and any promises (cross-contract calls) they created are emitted.
- If **any action fails** (e.g. a function call panics, a transfer hits insufficient balance, etc.), the entire transaction is reverted.

In other words: **within one transaction / receipt, it’s all-or-nothing.**

```admonish warning title="The atomicity boundary stops at the transaction itself"
Cross-contract calls created *by* your transaction run later as separate receipts. Once those child receipts have been emitted and executed on other contracts, their effects are **not** automatically rolled back if something else fails later—you must implement any “compensating logic” yourself.
```

## 2. The "Factory" Pattern (Batching)

Because of the atomicity rules above, we can safely use the "Factory" pattern: creating a new sub-account, funding it, deploying a contract to it, and initializing that contract—all in one transaction.

```admonish tip title="Why do it this way?"
If you deploy a contract but forget to initialize it, anyone could call `init` and take ownership. By bundling `deploy` and `init` in one atomic transaction, you guarantee that **only you** can initialize it, and if initialization fails, the account creation is rolled back entirely.
```

```typescript
import { generateKey } from "near-kit"
import { readFileSync } from "fs"

const wasm = readFileSync("./token.wasm")
const newKey = generateKey() // Generate a fresh KeyPair

const newAccountId = "token.alice.near"

await near
  .transaction("alice.near")
  // 1. Create the account on-chain
  .createAccount(newAccountId)

  // 2. Fund it (needs storage for the contract)
  .transfer(newAccountId, "6 NEAR")

  // 3. Add a Full Access Key so we can control it later
  .addKey(newKey.publicKey.toString(), { type: "fullAccess" })

  // 4. Deploy the compiled Wasm
  .deployContract(newAccountId, wasm)

  // 5. Initialize the contract state
  .functionCall(newAccountId, "init", {
    owner_id: "alice.near",
    total_supply: "1000000",
  })

  .send()

console.log("🚀 Deployed!")
```

## 3. Managing Access Keys

NEAR has a unique permission system based on Access Keys. You can add multiple keys to a single account with different permission levels.

### Adding a Restricted Key (FunctionCall)

This is how "Sign in with NEAR" works. You create a key that can **only** call specific methods on a specific contract. It cannot transfer NEAR.

```typescript
const appKey = generateKey()

await near
  .transaction("alice.near")
  .addKey(appKey.publicKey.toString(), {
    type: "functionCall",

    // The ONLY contract this key can interact with
    receiverId: "game.near",

    // The ONLY methods this key can call
    // (Empty array = Any method on this contract)
    methodNames: ["move", "attack", "heal"],

    // The max amount of gas fees this key can spend
    allowance: "0.25 NEAR",
  })
  .send()
```

```admonish info title="Understanding Allowance"
The `allowance` is a specific amount of NEAR set aside **strictly for gas fees**. It cannot be transferred or withdrawn. If the key uses up this allowance, it will be deleted automatically.
```

### Rotating Keys (Security)

To rotate keys (e.g., for security hygiene), you add a new key and delete the old one in the same transaction. This prevents you from locking yourself out.

```typescript
const newMasterKey = generateKey()

await near
  .transaction("alice.near")
  .addKey(newMasterKey.publicKey.toString(), { type: "fullAccess" })
  .deleteKey("alice.near", "ed25519:OLD_KEY...")
  .send()
```

## 4. Staking

You can stake NEAR natively with a validator to earn rewards.

```typescript
// Stake 100 NEAR with the 'figment' validator
await near
  .transaction("alice.near")
  .stake("figment.poolv1.near", "100 NEAR")
  .send()
```

```admonish note title="Unstaking"
To unstake, you typically need to call function methods (`unstake`, `withdraw`) on the staking pool contract rather than using a native action.
```

## 5. Deleting Accounts

You can delete an account to recover its storage rent (the NEAR locked to pay for its data). The account passed to `.transaction()` is the account being deleted, and the `beneficiary` receives the remaining NEAR balance.

```typescript
// Delete 'old-account.alice.near' and send all funds to 'alice.near'
await near
  .transaction("old-account.alice.near")
  .deleteAccount({ beneficiary: "alice.near" })
  .send()
```

## 6. Transaction Lifecycle & Finality

When you call `.send()`, you can control exactly when `near-kit` returns using the `waitUntil` option.

### The Lifecycle

1.  **Validation:** RPC checks structure.
2.  **Inclusion:** The transaction hits a validator node. Signature is checked, gas is pre-paid, nonce is updated.
3.  **Execution:** The receipt is processed. If it's a function call, the VM runs.
4.  **Finalization:** The block containing the transaction is finalized by consensus.

### `waitUntil` Options

You can pass these options to `.send({ waitUntil: "..." })`.

#### `EXECUTED_OPTIMISTIC` (Default)

- **Returns:** When the entire chain of receipts finishes execution.
- **Data:** Full logs and return values are available.

```admonish tip title="Best for most cases"
This is the default for a reason. It provides the return value you need for your UI, and happens relatively quickly (~2s).
```

#### `INCLUDED`

- **Returns:** When the transaction is in a block.
- **Data:** **No return values or logs are available yet.**

```admonish warning title="Missing Data"
Use `INCLUDED` only for "fire-and-forget" UI feedback. You cannot check if the smart contract call actually succeeded or failed logic checks yet.
```

#### `FINAL`

- **Returns:** When the block containing the _last_ receipt is finalized.
- **State:** 100% irreversible.

````admonish example title="High Value Transfer"
Use `FINAL` when moving large amounts of money to ensure 100% certainty.
```typescript
await near.transaction("alice.near")
  .transfer("bob.near", "10000 NEAR")
  .send({ waitUntil: "FINAL" });
```
