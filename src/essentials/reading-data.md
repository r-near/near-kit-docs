# Reading Data

Reading data from the blockchain is free, fast, and does not require a private key (unless you are connecting to a private node).

## 1. Calling View Methods

Use `near.view()` to query smart contracts. This connects to the RPC and fetches the state directly.

### Basic Usage

Arguments are automatically JSON-serialized for you.

```typescript
const messages = await near.view(
  "guestbook.near", // Contract ID
  "get_messages", // Method Name
  { limit: 10 } // Arguments object
)
```

### Typed Return Values

By default, `near.view` returns `any`. You can pass a generic type to get a strongly-typed response.

```typescript
// Define what the contract returns
type Message = {
  sender: string
  text: string
}

// Pass the type to .view<T>()
const messages = await near.view<Message[]>("guestbook.near", "get_messages", {
  limit: 10,
})

// Now 'messages' is typed as Message[]
console.log(messages[0].sender)
```

> **Pro Tip:** For even better type safety (including arguments), check out [Type-Safe Contracts](./type-safe-contracts.md).

## 2. Reading Historical Data (Time Travel)

By default, you read from the "Optimistic" head of the chain (the absolute latest state). Sometimes you need to read from a specific point in the past, or ensure you are reading fully finalized data.

Most read methods accept an options object as the last argument.

```typescript
// Read from a specific Block Height
await near.view(
  "token.near",
  "ft_balance_of",
  { account_id: "alice.near" },
  {
    blockId: 120494923,
  }
)

// Read from a specific Block Hash
await near.getBalance("alice.near", {
  blockId: "GZ8vK...",
})

// Read only "Final" data (slower, but immutable)
await near.view(
  "game.near",
  "get_winner",
  {},
  {
    finality: "final",
  }
)
```

## 3. Checking Balances

Use `near.getBalance()` to get a formatted, human-readable string.

```typescript
const balance = await near.getBalance("alice.near")
console.log(balance) // "10.50 NEAR"
```

> **Note:** If you need the raw BigInt value for calculations (yoctoNEAR), use `near.getAccountDetails("alice.near")`.

## 4. Batching Requests

If you need to make multiple read calls at once, use `near.batch()`. This runs them in parallel (like `Promise.all`) but preserves the types of the results in the returned tuple.

```typescript
const [balance, messages, exists] = await near.batch(
  near.getBalance("alice.near"),
  near.view<Message[]>("guestbook.near", "get_messages", {}),
  near.accountExists("bob.near")
)
```

## 5. Network Status

Use `near.getStatus()` to check the health of the node and the latest block height.

```typescript
const status = await near.getStatus()
console.log(`Latest Block: ${status.latestBlockHeight}`)
console.log(`Syncing: ${status.syncing}`)
```
