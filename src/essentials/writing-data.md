# Writing Data (Transactions)

To change state on the blockchain (send money, write to a contract), you must send a transaction. Transactions cost **Gas** and must be signed by an account with a private key.

## 1. The Transaction Builder

The primary way to write data is the fluent **Transaction Builder**. It allows you to chain multiple actions into a single, atomic package.

```typescript
const result = await near
  .transaction("alice.near") // 1. Who is paying? (Signer)
  .functionCall(
    // 2. Action
    "guestbook.near",
    "add_message",
    { text: "Hello World" }
  )
  .send() // 3. Sign & Broadcast
```

## 2. Atomicity (Batching Actions)

You can chain multiple actions in one transaction. **This is atomic**: either every action succeeds, or the entire transaction is rolled back.

This is perfect for scenarios like "Create an account AND fund it AND deploy a contract."

```typescript
await near
  .transaction("alice.near")
  .createAccount("bob.alice.near") // 1. Create
  .transfer("bob.alice.near", "1 NEAR") // 2. Fund
  .deployContract("bob.alice.near", code) // 3. Deploy Code
  .functionCall("bob.alice.near", "init", {}) // 4. Initialize
  .send()
```

If the `init` call fails, the account `bob.alice.near` will not be created, and the 1 NEAR will stay with Alice.

## 3. Attaching Gas & Deposits

When calling a function, you often need to attach Gas (computation limit) or a Deposit (real NEAR tokens).

These are passed as the 4th argument (the `options` object) to `.functionCall`.

```typescript
await near
  .transaction("alice.near")
  .functionCall(
    "nft.near",
    "mint_token",
    { token_id: "1" },
    {
      gas: "100 Tgas", // Limit for complex operations
      attachedDeposit: "0.1 NEAR", // Payment (e.g. for storage)
    }
  )
  .send()
```

- **Gas:** Defaults to 30 Tgas. Increase this for complex calculations.
- **Deposit:** Defaults to 0. Required if the contract needs to pay for storage or if you are transferring value to a contract.

## 4. Working with Amounts (Dynamic Values)

For dynamic calculations, use the `Amount` helper instead of manually constructing strings:

```typescript
import { Amount } from "near-kit"

// Dynamic NEAR amounts
const basePrice = 5
const quantity = 2
await near.send("bob.near", Amount.NEAR(basePrice * quantity)) // "10 NEAR"

// Fractional amounts
await near.send("bob.near", Amount.NEAR(10.5)) // "10.5 NEAR"

// YoctoNEAR (10^-24 NEAR) for precise calculations
await near.send("bob.near", Amount.yocto(1000000n)) // "1000000 yocto"

// Or pass bigint directly (treated as yoctoNEAR)
await near.send("bob.near", 1000000n)
```

**Constants:**
- `Amount.ZERO` → `"0 yocto"`
- `Amount.ONE_NEAR` → `"1 NEAR"`
- `Amount.ONE_YOCTO` → `"1 yocto"`

## 5. Shortcuts

For simple, single-action transactions, `near-kit` provides shortcuts. These are just syntax sugar around the builder.

```typescript
// Shortcut for .transaction().transfer().send()
await near.send("bob.near", "5 NEAR")

// Shortcut for .transaction().functionCall().send()
await near.call("counter.near", "increment", {})
```

## 6. Inspecting the Result

The `.send()` method returns a `FinalExecutionOutcome` object. This contains everything that happened on-chain.

```typescript
const result = await near.call(...);

// ✅ Check the Transaction Hash
console.log("Tx Hash:", result.transaction.hash);

// 📜 Check Logs
// Logs from ALL receipts in the transaction are collected here
const logs = result.receipts_outcome.flatMap(r => r.outcome.logs);
console.log("Contract Logs:", logs);

// 📦 Get the Return Value
// If the contract returned data (e.g. a JSON object), it's base64 encoded here.
if (result.status.SuccessValue) {
  const raw = Buffer.from(result.status.SuccessValue, 'base64').toString();
  const value = JSON.parse(raw);
  console.log("Returned:", value);
}
```

## 7. Execution Speed (WaitUntil)

By default, `.send()` waits until the transaction is "Optimistically Executed" (usually 1-2 seconds). You can change this behavior.

```typescript
// Fast: Returns as soon as the network accepts it. No return value available.
.send({ waitUntil: "INCLUDED" })

// Slow: Waits for full BFT Finality (extra 2-3 seconds). 100% irreversible.
.send({ waitUntil: "FINAL" })
```
