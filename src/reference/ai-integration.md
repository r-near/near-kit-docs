# For AI Agents

This documentation is available in formats optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs).

If you are using Cursor, ChatGPT, or Claude to help you write `near-kit` code, provide these files as context to ensure the AI uses the modern API instead of the legacy `near-api-js`.

- **`/llms.txt`**: A condensed index of topics.
- **`/llms-full.txt`**: The complete documentation text in a single file.

### Example Prompt

> "I am using the `near-kit` library (NOT near-api-js). Use the provided `llms-full.txt` context to help me write a script that deploys a contract."
