description: "How to use near-kit documentation with AI coding assistants"
---

This documentation is optimized for AI coding assistants. Whether you're using **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, or other AI tools, there are multiple ways to give them context about `near-kit`.

<Warning>
**Important:** `near-kit` is NOT `near-api-js`. AI models often confuse the two. Always provide context to ensure the AI uses the correct, modern API.
</Warning>

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP allows AI tools to connect directly to our documentation server. This gives your AI assistant live access to search and read the docs.

### Supported Tools

- **Claude Desktop** - Native MCP support
- **Cursor** - Via MCP extension
- **VS Code** - Via Copilot MCP extensions

### Connection URL

```
https://kit.near.tools/mcp
```

<Tip>
See [Mintlify's MCP documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/model-context-protocol) for setup instructions specific to your AI tool.

## Using with AI Assistants

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cursor / Windsurf">
    1. Open the **Chat** pane
    2. Type `@Docs` and add the URL: `https://kit.near.tools/llms-full.txt`
    3. Or use `@Web` to fetch any documentation page directly

    The editor will ingest the documentation as a reference file.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Claude Desktop">
    Connect via MCP for the best experience:

    1. Open Claude Desktop settings
    2. Add the MCP server: `https://kit.near.tools/mcp`
    3. Claude can now search and read the docs directly

    Or paste the llms-full.txt URL in your conversation.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ChatGPT">
    1. Paste the URL in your chat: `https://kit.near.tools/llms-full.txt`
    2. Ask ChatGPT to read and reference it
    3. Add the recommended prompt below
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="VS Code Copilot">
    Use the contextual menu on this site:

    1. Select code or text you want to reference
    2. Click the VS Code option in the popup menu
    3. The content opens in your editor for Copilot context
  </Tab>

## Recommended Prompt

When starting a new AI session, use this prompt to ensure accurate responses:

```text
I am building an application using the `near-kit` TypeScript library for NEAR blockchain.

IMPORTANT: `near-kit` is NOT `near-api-js`. They are completely different libraries.
- Do NOT use `near-api-js` patterns (like `utils.format`, `account.functionCall`, `BN`)
- Use human-readable strings for amounts: "10 NEAR", "30 Tgas"
- Use the fluent transaction builder: `near.transaction().transfer().send()`
- Reference the provided documentation as the source of truth
```

<Note>
This prompt helps prevent the AI from hallucinating `near-api-js` patterns, which is a common issue since that library has more training data.
</Note>
