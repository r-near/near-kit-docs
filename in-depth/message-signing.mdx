title: "Message Signing (Authentication)"
---

Transactions change the blockchain state and cost gas. Sometimes, you just want to prove **who you are**.

Message Signing (standardized in [NEP-413](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0413)) allows a user to sign a piece of data with their private key off-chain. This is free, instant, and is the standard way to implement **"Log in with NEAR"**.

## How it Works

1.  **Client:** Generates a random "nonce" and asks the user to sign a specific message.
2.  **Wallet:** Shows the message to the user. If approved, it returns a cryptographic signature.
3.  **Backend:** Verifies the signature against the user's public key and checks the nonce to prevent replay attacks.

## 1. The Client (Frontend)

Use `near.signMessage` to request a signature.

You **must** generate a random nonce. This ensures that a captured signature cannot be re-used by an attacker later.

```typescript
import { Near, generateNonce } from "near-kit"

// 1. Generate a random 32-byte nonce with embedded timestamp
const nonce = generateNonce()

// 2. Request Signature
const signedMessage = await near.signMessage({
  message: "Log in to MyApp", // What the user sees
  recipient: "myapp.com", // Your app identifier (prevents phishing)
  nonce: nonce,
})

// 3. Send to Backend
await fetch("/api/login", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    signedMessage,
    nonce: Array.from(nonce), // Convert Uint8Array to array for JSON
  }),
})
```

The `signature` field is base64 encoded per the NEP-413 specification. Send it unchanged to your backend.

## 2. The Server (Backend)

**Automatic Expiration:** Nonces include an embedded timestamp. Signatures older than 5 minutes are automatically rejected, limiting the replay attack window.

```typescript
import { Near, verifyNep413Signature } from "near-kit"

const near = new Near({ network: "mainnet" })

app.post("/api/login", async (req, res) => {
  const { signedMessage, nonce } = req.body
  // Reconstruct nonce buffer from the JSON array
  const nonceBuffer = Buffer.from(nonce)

  // 1. Verify Signature
  const isValid = await verifyNep413Signature(
    signedMessage,
    {
      message: "Log in to MyApp", // Must match exactly what was signed
      recipient: "myapp.com", // Must match YOUR app
      nonce: nonceBuffer, // Must match the nonce sent
    },
    { near }
  )

  if (!isValid) {
    return res.status(401).send("Invalid or expired signature")
  }

  // 2. (Recommended) Check for Replays
  // if (db.seenNonces.has(nonceBuffer.toString('hex'))) ...

  // 3. Success!
  console.log(`User verified: ${signedMessage.accountId}`)
  res.send({ token: "session_token_123" })
})
```

This verifies the cryptographic signature and confirms the public key belongs to the claimed account as a full access key.

Customize expiration window if needed:

```typescript
// Accept signatures up to 10 minutes old
await verifyNep413Signature(signedMessage, params, { near, maxAge: 10 * 60 * 1000 })
```

You can also check key existence directly:

```typescript
// Returns true if the key exists and is a full access key
const hasKey = await near.fullAccessKeyExists("alice.near", "ed25519:...")
```

<Warning title="Security Critical: Replay Attacks">
Cryptographic verification alone is not enough! If you do not check if the `nonce` has been used before, an attacker who intercepts the signed message can "replay" it to your server to log in as the user again.

**Always store used nonces in your database (with an expiration time) and reject duplicates.**
</Warning>

## Type Definition

The `SignedMessage` object returned by the client and sent to the server looks like this:

```typescript
type SignedMessage = {
  accountId: string // "alice.near"
  publicKey: string // "ed25519:..."
  signature: string // Base64-encoded signature per NEP-413 spec
}
```

`near.signMessage` returns a base64-encoded signature as specified in NEP-413. `verifyNep413Signature` also accepts legacy base58 signatures (with or without key type prefix) for backward compatibility.
