<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a file named index.ts">
    ```typescript
    import { Near } from "near-kit"

    async function main() {
      // 1. Initialize the client
      // In a real app, ALWAYS use environment variables for keys!
      const near = new Near({
        network: "testnet",
        privateKey: "ed25519:...", // Replace with your actual private key
        defaultSignerId: "your-account.testnet", // Replace with your account ID
      })

      console.log("🔗 Connected to Testnet")

      // 2. Read some data (Free!)
      // Let's check the balance of the account we just connected
      const balance = await near.getBalance("your-account.testnet")
      console.log(`💰 Balance: ${balance}`)

      // 3. Write some data (Send a transaction)
      // We will send 1 NEAR to ourselves.
      // Note: "1 NEAR" is a string. No math required.
      console.log("💸 Sending 1 NEAR...")

      const result = await near
        .transaction("your-account.testnet")
        .transfer("your-account.testnet", "1 NEAR")
        .send()

      console.log(`✅ Transaction successful!`)
      console.log(`   Hash: ${result.transaction.hash}`)
    }

    main().catch(console.error)
