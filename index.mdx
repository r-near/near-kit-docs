description: "A modern, lightweight TypeScript SDK for NEAR blockchain"
---

Welcome to `near-kit`.

If you have built on NEAR before, you know that the tooling can sometimes feel... heavy. `near-kit` is an attempt to fix that. It is a modern, lightweight, and opinionated TypeScript SDK designed to make interacting with the NEAR blockchain feel as simple as using `fetch`.

## Why `near-kit`?
